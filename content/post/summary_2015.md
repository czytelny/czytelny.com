That's it, 2015 is moving toward inevitable end. I received an email from Wordpress with summary of my blogging activities, so I decided to write my own summary of outgoing year. I think it may be a bit of fun in the future to read it, and what's even more important - great piece of motivation. If on next December I won't know what to write in such summary, it will be a sign that I'm doing something terribly wrong :)

# Activities
#### Blog
It's easily measurable. In 2015 I have written **5** blog posts about programming. It's a miserably poor result, nevertheless better this than nothing!
Except writing posts I also made a migration from a Wordpress CMS: [czytelnyblog](!czytelnyblog.wordpress.com) to a static page generator Hugo (plus private hosting and domain czytelny.com).
#### OpenSource
I can say that this year was my first serious initiation with a github. Although I haven't contributed to any popular repositories I committed some stuff: 

- [rt-web](https://github.com/Cybercom-Poland/rt-web) <br>
With my [colleague](https://arturbylak.wordpress.com/) we stared to develop a Java framework, based on Vertx, to allow create real-time webapps with vertx easily. It's on very early development stage.

- [czytelny.com](https://github.com/czytelny/czytelny.com)<br> 
Source code of this blog is also on Github.  

- [BIL](https://github.com/czytelny/bil) <br>
My sandbox library. It's still work in progress and purpose of this is to create unobtrusive CMS, extremely flexible and easy to use... hopefully more details soon. 

- [vnerv](https://github.com/czytelny/nerve) <br>
Tiny library for event broadcasting. It's ES5 compliant, small and easy.

- [tiny-request-watcher](https://github.com/czytelny/tiny-requests-watcher) <br>
It's a javascript library which allows to display custom spinner/loader for chosen requests - for example long lasting one. Not very useful from today's point of view, but it's first working "thing" in my repos;)
 
# Technologies
In short: dive to Javascript and Angular. 

Regarding JS: I made big progress in understanding fundamentals of language. I also learned about tools like Grunt, Gulp, and new shining standard: ES6 with compiler like Babel. My ultimate goal was to understand well designed front-end environment. With such accumulation of existing tools it isn't easy, but piece by piece I'm closer ;)

Angular: I made 2 big setups for Angular apps. First of them doesn't make me proud, but lesson was learned. I think I can say, with some degree of certainty, that I know and understand basic concepts of Angular pretty well.

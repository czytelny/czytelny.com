Just like [last year](http://czytelny.com/post/summary_2015/) I decided to write down thoughts regarding my professional growth in past year. Let's start from reviewing plans:

- [ ] Write at least 10 technical blog posts
- [x] ~~Master ES6 syntax~~
- [x] ~~Finish at least alpha version of BIL~~
- [ ] Write something with Angular 2 (when it eventually will be released) … and if it’s fun - master it
- [x] ~~write something with React … and if it’s fun - master it~~
- [ ] Read “Coders at work” by Peter Seibel
- [ ] Learn 500 new words in English


According to sophisticated analytics I had produced only 6 posts;) Definitely there is a field for improvement in 2017... :) loose thoughts: write down blog post ideas / write short posts 

Maybe I'm not a master of ES2015 **yet**. But I'm using it extensively in my daily routine at work thus it's better every day: decoupling, default parameters, arrow functions - piece of cake.

Regarding my awesome library named *BIL*. I abandoned concept of it after tampered with proof of concept. I realized that my initial assumptions regarding possibility of usage FTP connection and it's security were wrong. Long story short, I decided to not continue work on this project.

I haven't touched ng2 yet, but... a lot of React instead! It's a kind of surprise to me, because I recall that when I wrote down plans last year, I was rather eager jump in Angular 2 which was in beta. Then I saw a survey for developers, where plenty of folks stated out that they really appreciate React's *way* of doing things and it's direct relation with pure javascript. So I gave it a try and I must admit that it's pretty awesome. I have learned a lot about React, Redux and love to continue.

Apart from things which I planned, a lot of other good things had happened. First of all I dive into MongoDB basics through awesome course: **MongoDB for Node.js Developers**. I also wrote my first [github library](https://github.com/czytelny/redux-socket.io-middleware) which actually is usable for somebody - it's really awesome! I also contributed to [socketio-client-tool](https://github.com/amritb/socketio-client-tool) and created [temperature monitor](http://czytelny.com/temp/) with raspberry pi - as a pet project.

The biggest thing though, which I am the most excited about is brand new project which I started with my friends few months ago. We named it **[Arij](https://github.com/czytelny/arij)** and it's going to be a project management tool (Jira like), ease to use, fast, free and open-source. The most exciting things are technologies: backend with Node.js (express), frontend with React+Redux, MongoDB as a database..last couple of months we had been gathering requirements and had a lot of long discussions regarding them and general direction to take on. We are at the moment when we know **where** to go, so I'm thrilled where it will lead us:) I hope that by the end of 2017 we can actually release version 1.0 as minimum viable product.

Yeah, maybe I'm not very regular nor too frequent writer nevertheless I eventually decided to migrate to something more predictable than Wordpress. What's wrong with it you may ask. Well, it happens that some posts evolved during time even though I didn't touch them (especially code, formatting etc). And it's sooo bloated.

I picked one of the static site generator called **Hugo** and so far I’m so happy that I’m considering to learn Go language, because Hugo is written in that quick beast;) and i can write posts in markdown! another hurray.

I'll also try to write somewhat more often:)
